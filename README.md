Version 1.0.0
## About
This repo contains a project in which automated grading of simulations is the goal. This grading is done by first recording the simulation visuals, 
then giving this data to a machine learning model which has to learn if the visual is either correct or incorrect. All tests of these aspects will
together determine the grade the simulation gets. 

NOTE: this is still very much a work in progress
